TODO
See if StudentDatabase does any DB data entry and CRUD.
    Run it and it fails with "SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'" because it's python2.
    It's running OK with python2.
    student_db.db - login user, password
    open student_db.db inside pycharm gets
    Sqliteman
    Sqlite3 executable 'sqlite3' is not found in your path. Some features will be disabled.
    OK - launches Sqliteman; tables admin (name, password) {admin, password},
    students (first_name, last_name, student_id, phone, parent_address, sex)
    No obvious data browse or SQL run in Sqliteman.
    Open "DB Browser for SQLite"; admin (name, password) {admin, password},
    There's an ADD STUDENT screen; enter data; Submit;
    "4"	"Dale"	"Moore"	"314"	"210-681-9153"	"5602 Charlie Chan, San Antonio, Texas 78240"	"M"
    YEAH!

Is the Search implemented? I can't seem to get to it. Nope, no screen, nothing fleshed out.
